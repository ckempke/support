Welcome to chriskempke.com, unsurprisingly, the home of Christopher Kempke, LLC.  

If you're here because you've discovered a problem in (or just need help with) our software, please let us know by email at  support@chriskempke.com.   If you're looking for our privacy policy, see below.

## Privacy Policy

For all current Christopher Kempke, LLC.  products:

We are not in the business of collecting personal information.   If we get any on us, we'll wash it off.

Our software is available through various App Stores (currently, just ones run by Apple).  Their [privacy policy is here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).   As part of the purchase/download process, Apple sends us certain information by e-mail, and certain information is available in the developer dashboard.    This may include your e-mail address (or a forwarding e-mail address if you use Apple's privacy features), and some general geographic data (what country you're in, what currency you used, and some tax stuff), but is otherwise pretty limited.

**We reserve the right to use those e-mail addresses in the event of critical need.**   That would be something like "Hey, there's a bug in the current version that deletes your data, don't use it!"

Otherwise, that information is archived and stored, but not otherwise used beyond what's necessary to handle transactions (and if you initiate them, service support requests.)   We do not market by e-mail, sell information about our customers, or otherwise use your personal information for any purpose whatsoever other than to take up some space on our hard drives.

## Cookies

This site does not use cookies in any way that we're aware of, and we will update this policy if we decide we need some for some reason or other.

However; this site is hosted through GitHub Pages and Google Domains (or Squarespace, or whoever it's been sold to this week), and it's very likely one or more of these upstream providers is doing analytics on things like number of visitors and such.   Those systems may use cookies or logging per their own privacy policies and terms of service.
