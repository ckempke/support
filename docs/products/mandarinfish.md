# Mandarin Fish



![Mandarin Fish Logo](../media/mandarin_fish.png)

For many years, [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) (named after a fish) has been the gold standard of Chinese dictionaries.   But it supports neither the Mac (as of this writing, although it's been "coming soon" for years) nor the new Apple Vision Pro, both of which are important platforms for this developer.

Enter *Mandarin Fish.*   While it can't hope to compete with the Pleco's years of features, it brings the critical ones:  

- flash card study, (both old and new HSK word lists are provided)

- a substantial Chinese/English dictionary,

- being named after a fish 

Mandarin Fish is available on all of your favorite Apple platforms, as long as you're not one of those "my favorite platform is an Apple Watch" heathens.  (Apple TV fans, keep an eye out.   Text-entry-heavy apps aren't really ideal for the TV, but we're looking to see if there's opportunities there.)

A "universal purchase," you get *Mandarin Fish* for all supported platforms with a single purchase.    No buying on each platform, and *no subscriptions!*

We're in the last (we hope) few rounds of beta testing here, so *Mandarin Fish* should be available shortly from the App Store of your preferred Apple Platform.     At that point, someone should be along to add a link and some screen shots here....
